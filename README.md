This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Concept:

I wanted to learn Morse Code, so I thought I'd build a game to help myself practice. This is obviously not a complete game, but it's a step in that direction.

### Goals:

- a button switch that, when pressed, makes a noise and triggers an alert
  - display a large black button in the bottom middle of the screen
  - when the button is pressed:
    - a sound plays while the button is pressed
    - the app alerts with "good job!"

- a goal regarding button pressing
  - display a 'say this' field above the button
  - grayed out target signal -- a dot or dash above the word 'dot' or 'dash'

- a goal that, when accomplished, triggers an alert
  - clicking and holding the button or pressing the spacebar for less than .3 seconds inputs a dot
  - clicking and holding or pressing the spacebar for more than .6 seconds inputs a dash
  - when the target signal is input, the app alerts "good job!"
